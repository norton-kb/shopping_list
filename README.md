# shopping_list
## Overview
This project is a simple interactive shopping list application that allows users to add items, mark them as purchased, edit existing items, and clear the list. The application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with local storage for persistence, so items remain even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Clear List**: A button to clear all items from the list.
- **Persistence**: The shopping list is saved in local storage, so it remains available after refreshing the page.
